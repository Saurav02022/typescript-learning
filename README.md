# Learning TypeScript

This repository contains my notes and code examples from my TypeScript learning journey.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It was developed and maintained by Microsoft and offers a range of features, such as static type checking, classes, interfaces, and modules, that make it easier to write large-scale applications.

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources that I'm using to learn TypeScript:

- [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - The official handbook for TypeScript, with in-depth explanations and examples.
- [TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) - A free online book that covers TypeScript in detail.
- [TypeScript on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) - An interactive online course that teaches the basics of TypeScript.
- [TypeScript on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/typescript) - A video course that covers the fundamentals of TypeScript.

## Code Examples

In the `src` folder, you'll find a collection of code examples that I've been working on while learning TypeScript. These examples cover topics such as:

- Basic types and variables
- Functions and methods
- Interfaces and classes
- Modules and namespaces
- Generics and advanced types
